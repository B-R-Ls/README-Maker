Given nothing but directions and open functions, I inputed the necessary code inorder to create a README Generator. This project allowed me to further understand the inner workings of node and packages. I crated a program that ask simple questions inorder to make proffesional READMEs. 

## Installation

[Repository](https://github.com/B-R-Ls/README-Maker)

## Usage

The program will initialize by asking the user a series of questions. The data from those questions are then inputed into a frame for a approprate README. Once it's finished It will create a markdown file with all the information formated in a prebuilt frame.
